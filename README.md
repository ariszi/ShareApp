==================================
In this documentation i m going to mentions some of the architectures, frameworks, librarys, conventions, etc that i m going to use in order to complete this project.

# Commit convention Overview
The commits will be structured with the format of [Purpose]: [Description]
The purpose will have a wide variaty on key works like feature, refactor, fix, tests, etc.

# Architecture Overview
This project will use a reactive approach for its presentation layer. It will observe sources of the state, it will react on their changes, and it will create a state from the combination of those reaction(s). This approach can handle the projects' requirements.
(This approach in bigger projects might be a bottleneck since the combine function can take up to 5 items. <-- Debatable)
